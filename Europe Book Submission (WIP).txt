“Good luck in there, Eli,” someone wished him.


“Aww, what’s the worst that could happen? We lose a multi-million dollar contract?”


His joke was met with stony silence, the tension in the room tightening to a palpable coil. People fidgeted, their gazes glued to their phones, anything but him. Eli took a deep breath, dragging his feet across the carpeted floor. He was walking into the dragon’s den, and today, luck was all he had.


“So, it’s truly been a while, how are you all doing?” The man dressed neatly across the table greeted Eli as he walked in.


“It really has been, Sir,” Eli said, striving for a calm and collected tone. “We’ve been working tirelessly, and I assure you, today you’ll see the culmination of it.”


“I really hope so,” he replied, expecting a chuckle, but no one so much as blinked.


“I think that went well,” Eli announced to his coworkers at a lunch table, already halfway through a plate of day-old steamed potatoes.


“Hopefully it did, because we’re kind of underwater, and that deal would really help our case,” came the anxious reply.


“Just relax, man! I got it under control!” Eli shot back, confidence gleaming in his eyes.


He stood up, carrying his tray across the checkered floor tiles. Despite his outward bravado, he genuinely didn’t know if it had gone well. He shrugged off the thought and continued with his day.


Click, clack, click. The office echoed with the incessant tapping of fingers, people slaving away at emails and cases. Eli trepidatiously watched the clock until it struck 5:31. The moment it did, he grabbed his briefcase and began his escape from the purgatory that was his office. Walking past his floor’s receptionist, he waved goodbye and scanned his ID on the cold steel detector. The elevator was empty, a rare luxury these days. Eli quickly hit the close button, ensuring it stayed that way. As the elevator slowly whirred down the floors, he pulled out a pair of well-worn, yellowed earbuds. Not from age, but from the sheer use and abuse they’d endured. Soon, all signs of worry or disdain were replaced by the godly gift of music.


Tapping his foot along to a 90s disco song, he got off the elevator at the basement floor. He clicked his key fob, the sound echoing from his car. He half-danced, half-hopped his way to his vehicle. This was no longer the Eli who needed to be critical of everything; this was a carefree Eli.


Starting up his car, he connected his phone to the aux, turning his once-drab vehicle into a lively jamming studio. Rolling out of the carpark, he considered it for a while. “Yeah, I’ll get some dinner tonight,” he murmured to himself. “A guy’s gotta celebrate, you know?”


About 14 minutes later, he sat at a Chinese takeout place. It wasn’t much, but it was his little treat in this mundane life. Drumming his foot to an upbeat rock song, he took out his phone to catch up on the news. Stares pivoted in his direction as he realized his tapping was a little too loud and obnoxious. Eli kept to himself and ordered his usual.


When his food arrived, he was deeply engrossed in his phone screen. It was a captivating news story about a lady who listened to astrological signs and, by sheer happenstance, won a $44 million lottery. Eli sighed in elated daydream, imagining the impossibility of that happening to him. The young waiter cleared his throat, jolting Eli’s head out of the clouds. Eli nodded an apology, took his food, and paid on the spot. Gosh, stuff is cheap here, why can’t everywhere be like this? Eli thought to himself. He turned on his favorite podcast and began munching down on the savory fried rice dish in front of him. As he chewed, the podcast began discussing the hot topics of the week.


After absolutely devouring the delicious dish, his phone rang. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion before he answered cautiously. What could Paul want at such a late hour?


“Hey Eli,” Paul’s voice buzzed with bad reception, but the disappointment was obvious. Or perhaps it was disdain for something Eli had done.


“Evenin’ Paul,” Eli replied, reaching for his water.


“I’m sorry, Eli…” Paul paused, swallowing hard. “They forced my hand.”


“Paul, I have no idea what’s going on right now,” Eli said, gesturing instinctively at his phone. “But you gotta start from the beginning.”


“They fired you,” Paul choked out, then fell silent again.


“What?” Eli replied, not mad, but certainly not in the happiest voice. “Is this a prank?”


“No, man…” Paul continued. “You messed up the deal with Charles today; he’s going with a different firm.” Eli couldn’t have blurted out a reply if his life depended on it. His mind went completely blank. “I’ve gotta get back, I’m on the clock, but if you need anything tonight… a place to crash or something, I’ve got you covered.” The click of the call ending followed.


What the fuck? Eli thought, staring blankly at his phone. He shifted his focus to his empty plate. That’s exactly how his mind felt right now: empty, devoid of purpose.


“Waiter… I need something to soothe the nerves,” he called out to the young man who was lost in conversation with his coworkers. At his job. Eli drowned his feelings in a 12-ounce beer, and not long after, he couldn’t properly recall any of the information he had just drunkenly shared.


The blinding lights of a nearby pub spilled over the curb like toxic runoff, illuminating the cracked pavement and the slack faces of men who had long since emptied their souls into a bottle. They drifted past like ghosts in cheap cologne, dragging their feet toward rusted hatchbacks or waiting rides—disappearing into the night one by one.


Eli watched them through the pub's grimy front window, cheek resting on a half-curled fist. He wasn’t sure how long he'd been sitting there, nursing the same drink. It was warm now, bitter in a way that no longer felt alcoholic. Just wrong.


He didn’t slur. He didn’t shout. He just… existed. A body in a booth. A thoughtless flick of the eyes to his watch told him it was late enough to regret this in the morning. Time to go.


The air outside was sharper than he expected, slicing through his booze-dulled senses. The wind bit at the collar of his coat. Eli took two steps, then staggered a third. He chuckled under his breath at his own stumble—low, bitter, not quite amused.


His car blinked at him from across the lot like an old friend too tired to judge. Fumbling with the key fob, he finally unlocked it and yanked open the driver’s door, the hinges screaming like they knew better.


He sank into the seat, leaned forward, key in hand—then froze.


A knock.


Sharp. Flat.


He flinched, head snapping to the left, stomach already plummeting. Please not a cop. Please not a cop. Please—


But it wasn’t.
Just a man.


Older. Calm. His face was lined like it had been folded in half a few too many times. But there was something else—something grounded. Like he knew the ending to stories you hadn’t even started reading yet.


Eli squinted and cracked the window.


“Hello...?” he said, suspicion tucked behind his slur.


The man’s lips curled upward—not quite a smile.


“Hello, son,” the voice said. Smooth as oak. Heavy as lead.


“Uh…hell..o?” Eli garbled back amidst his lightheadedness. “Should I know you?”


The man chuckled. It wasn’t a cold chuckle, but one of warmth and comfort, as if they were good friends from halcyon days. “No, but everyone knows me,” he said, his voice remaining steadfast. “Look, I’ll make this quick, I’m a quite famous person around here… I won’t take up much of your time—” The figure began, then paused, considering his words.


“I am… one of a higher plane,” he stated, as if it were a widely known fact.
“Yo man, I don’t know who you are or where you’re from, but you gotta get the fuck outta here, I need to get my shit straight,” Eli replied in a more annoyed tone.


“Very well, but just know this, my child, I see you’ve been suffering… my sources tell me you’ve lost your job recently?” The man’s lips drew tightly together in a slight grin, almost as if he knew every single detail about Eli and was just waiting to pull that ace from his dirt-ridden sleeves.


“How the hel—” Eli started, about to drive off out of fear, but the mysterious man interrupted him. “Do not question me, child,” his smile disappearing, replaced by a steeled face. “I understand that you may be angry or confused, but you must know just this: flourish your next 48 hours as if death were on your doorstep.”


“Wait, does that mean—” Eli began, but was cut off again. “No, you won’t die, and no, I’m not sending a snail to kill you or some stupid shit like that. Your next two days will be free of charge.”


“What the hell’s that s’posed to mean?”


“You’ll see it soon, my child… for now… sleep.”


That was all Eli could remember before he succumbed to his weariness. It was almost magical. Unnatural, yet those hours of sleep, in his car, were the most rejuvenating he’d ever had. In his head, it was dark. No dreams, no nightmares, no one. Just the figure’s words bearing their weight on him.


Tap, tap… TAP!


Someone was knocking on Eli’s window. Eli’s mind raced. Was this a police officer taking his ass down to the station for parking overnight? Was it the homeless guy again? Was it—oh, so it is a cop. Shit.


“Uhh…hey officer! How you doin’ today?” Eli said, traces of sweat running down his brow.


“Mornin’, Son,” the officer said in a deep voice. That word. Son. He’d definitely heard that somewhere… Eli’s mind sidetracked.


“So, where are you headed?”


Eli cleared his throat before responding with a clearer state of mind. “I just got a little drunk last night, so I decided to sleep it out. I hope it’s okay?”


The officer eyed him up and down, thinking deeply about his alibi. “Sure, pal… I just need you to blow into this breathalyzer really quickly.”


“Oh, come on, officer, is that really necessary…?” Eli tried his luck. He wasn’t budging that day.


The drive home was a blur of hazy confusion. Why was he here? What had happened last night? It felt like a fever dream, a memory that didn't quite belong, a lucid dream he couldn't shake. The pub's murky glow, the biting cold, the strange man... But then, as he turned onto his street, the connection snapped into place. It was like the floodgates of his memory had burst open, and everything flooded back in excruciating, high-definition clarity: the bizarre encounter, the impossible promise, his desperate actions, the sense of invincibility.


He half-heartedly pulled his car into the small driveway, the gravel crunching under the tires like a harsh judgment. Inside, he dropped onto his sofa. It wasn't a big place, just a simple bachelor pad, but it was good enough. Just enough space to breathe, but not enough space to sigh in relief.


Eli racked his mind, trying to find an explanation for all that had happened last night. 48 hours? What could that possibly mean… he thought, before his lips dropped into a look of dismay. Does that mean I… DIE?! Okay, Eli, think logically… He swiveled his chair over to the nearby desk where he kept his trusty old laptop. Searching on the internet yielded nothing but one singular forum post. It was from a user who told an extremely similar story to his, asking if anyone knew what this mysterious 48 hours could mean. He was met mostly with ridicule, people telling him he needed to get off the schizo pills. However, there was one post that stood out, a light at the end of the tunnel. This user suggested it could be related to ancient folklore, a tale of a man at his lowest—absolutely devastated, completely torn, and unable to continue. At this point, it was foretold that an intriguing stranger would give you 48 hours to live life with a cheat code: everything you did would be reversed after 48 hours.


Eli slumped back in his chair, frowning at the mere pixels on his screen that suggested he had stumbled across the craziest opportunity of his life. Could it be true? Ah, fuck it, let’s go rob a bank.


Eli, as a matter of fact, didn’t rob a bank. Instead, he lay there on his bed. What if it isn’t real and I rob the bank and they shoot the shit outta me? These thoughts plagued Eli’s mind, sending him into a crazed frenzy with dark clouds spouting the most absurd possibilities every so often. He decided, whether or not it was real, he’d just have to find out. Picking up his phone, he decided that with his newfound freedom, he’d first start with… pizza. Gourmet. Fucking. Pizza.


Fifteen grueling, stomach-clenching, and painful minutes later, his pizza arrived on his doorstep. Sure, there were definitely more productive things to do with that time, but hey, a guy’s gotta get his noggin warmed up. While Eli devoured the pizza, he thought it over. What would he do to make the next 48 hours worth it?


Okay, Eli, this is it. Forty-eight hours. Everything reversible. What does that even mean? He chewed slowly, the hot cheese burning his tongue, but he barely noticed. No consequences. Zero. I could… I could finally tell Charles exactly what I thought of him. No, too petty. Too much wasted energy.


His mind raced, a chaotic scramble of forbidden desires. I could quit this apartment, just walk out. No rent, no bills. For two days, anyway. But then what? I'd be homeless again on Monday. Unless… unless I just bought a new place. A mansion. Cash. From where? The bank. No, no, don't think about that. That's a trap.


He swiped a dollop of grease from his chin. What about travel? Paris, Tokyo, anywhere. First class. Just get on a plane. No passport, no ticket, just… go. Would they even stop me? And if they did, what's the worst that could happen? It all resets anyway. A grin tugged at the corner of his mouth. That's a good one. Get a taste of the good life, no strings attached.


Or… or I could actually fix something. That's a stretch. Could I actually help someone without consequence? Like, steal from the rich and give to the poor, Robin Hood style? Too much effort. Too much risk, even if it resets. What if I felt the bullet before it reversed? No thanks.


He polished off another slice. This is bigger than just me. This is... an experiment. A pure, unadulterated shot at absolute freedom. What would the freest man in the world do for 48 hours? Anything. Everything. But where do you even start when 'anything' is on the table?


Then his gaze drifted to his phone, lying face down on the table. A name flashed in his mind. Not a bank, not a plane ticket, but something infinitely more terrifying and exhilarating. Chloe. He hadn't seen her in ages, not properly, not since that awkward coffee shop encounter where he'd almost, almost blurted it out. The confession. The one that had been stuck in his throat for years. The fear of rejection, of ruining the friendship, had always been a solid brick wall. But now? Now there are no consequences. He could tell her everything. Every unspoken feeling, every daydream, every time he’d seen her and wished… Yes. His jaw tightened. That’s it. That’s where I start.


Wiping his hands on his worn pants, he picked up his phone. With trembling hands, he placed each finger on the keyboard one by one and began typing. Hey so I’ve been thinking about you… No, that's too direct. Or is it? He jabbed his finger towards the delete button, rethinking his magnum opus.


He finally decided. "How are you?" It wasn’t a formal text, it wasn’t too upfront, and best of all, it wasn’t risky. Not like he couldn’t take it. Eli got up from his phone to brush his teeth. While staring in the mirror, he realized just how messed up he looked. Last night had been a rollercoaster ride. Hair an undone mess, eyes bloodshot red, and his shirt no longer the neatly tucked company shirt it once was.


“Damn, I need a shower,” he said aloud. Stepping into the shower, the morning light made the water glisten and sparkle as it hit his skin. Water had never felt this godly to a man before. It was like rediscovering fire during the winter apocalypse. It was simply lovely.


After his much-needed shower, he dried himself and donned a simple outfit: a long pair of cargo pants and a decently sized T-shirt. Nothing too plain, nothing that would make a homeless guy pale in comparison.


While spraying his cologne, he remembered the text message he had sent before taking a shower. Surely it had reached its recipient by now. Holding his phone with both hands, he checked his messages. Sure enough, there was a notification. Was it just one of his idiot friends sending him some dumbass meme? Nope. It was her.


I’m doing alright hbu? the text read. He stared at the blue text bubble, thinking, God, I’m a wreck, it’s over text and I still can’t get over my heebie jeebies? He typed out a response, and just as he was about to hit send, he froze. Was this it? Was he finally about to ask her to “hang out”? Was he going to die a lame guy who couldn’t muster up the balls to ask her out, even with this invincibility? Hell no. He deleted his response and sent her the message: "It’s better now that I’m talking to you :)"


He hit send and tossed his phone down. The butterflies in his stomach jolted him about, and he almost wanted to kick his feet up in the most giddy and joyful manner ever. He resisted the urge and prepared to leave the house. If he was going to get a date, he’d need a job. Where might I get one, you ask? Well, that’s simple. Just the largest tech startup known to mankind right now. Hey, why not, right?


Picking up his briefcase, he clicked it open to reveal the mess of documents from his last job. To hell with those guys, I can do my own thing now. Rummaging through his nearby drawer, he finally managed to fish out a hefty stack of papers. This was a report he had written on the implications of a new and advancing technology he had been very interested in. However, despite all the upsides of using cloud to do their processing, the company had turned Eli down big time. They ridiculed him. Called him insane. But now, was different. It was finally time to give it another shot.


With his briefcase locked and loaded, Eli strutted to his car. Throwing the briefcase into the backseat, he started the engine and amidst the chaos he had forgotten to refuel his car. Normally, he’d go into the house and pull out a spare gallon of gas but today. Today was different. He shifted the car into drive and pulled out of his small porch.


Pulling into the gas station, he parked next to a gas pump and pushed his way into the storefront. The clerk, a young woman probably no older than twenty with tired eyes and a name tag reading "Sarah," slowly looked up from her phone, her expression a mix of weary confusion and mild alarm. She raised an eyebrow. "Can I help you, sir?" she asked, her voice flat, clearly unimpressed.


Eli chuckled, leaning in conspiratorially. "You absolutely can, Sarah. See, I'm in a bit of a bind, my car's running on fumes, and I, uh, seem to have forgotten my wallet." He gestured vaguely to his pockets. "But you know, a pretty face like yours, I bet you could make an exception? Just for me?" He tried another wink, holding it a bit too long. "Consider it... a little something for a new friend?"


Sarah stared at him, her tired eyes widening slightly not in recognition, but in dawning comprehension. A slow, disgusted look spread across her face. Her lips thinned.


Just as Eli thought he saw a slight smile crack on her face it was gone in the next millisecond. “Sir, I hope you know, we have CCTVs on the premises and I will not think twice about butt dailing the police and getting your ass hauled down to the station,” Her expression conveyed a strong message of being revolted by even the thought of Eli’s attempt at a flirt.
“Jesus, okay, I’ll pay. I need 20$ on pump 7,”


“I’m so glad we could get something in that head of yours to click,” Sarah’s expression suddenly bloomed into a very sarcastic cherry blossom as she took the crumpled 20$ bill from the counter.


Walking out, Eli could feel the air get heavier and a little bit of sweat on his back. God, I am never doing that again, should’ve asked that hobo for like 100 charisma or something He thought to himself as he walked back over to the pump. Pumping gas into his dull orange car, he waited for it to fill. And then it stopped at- Wait, 15 Bucks?! Just as Eli was about to storm back into the storefront he glanced at the clerk and noticed she had her phone and looked at him with a blank stare. Touche Sarah, touche. He didn’t bother and just hopped into his car again. He had more important things to do with his time.
